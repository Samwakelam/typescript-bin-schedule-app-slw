# Bin Day

This application is designed for a very simple application:

What Bin is it this week?

![Black Bin](public/assets/screenshots/screenshot-black.png)
![Green Bin](public/assets/screenshots/screenshot-green.png)

The application shows the user the week of the year they are in and the colour of the bin to put out.
